# TITLE: AGE AT MENARCHE AND RISK OF BREAST CANCER IN BRCA1 AND BRCA2 MUTATION CARRIERS  

---

## SUMMARY

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with more than 2.25 million new cases and approximately 680,000 deaths each year (Sung et al., 2021). While environmental and lifestyle factors have a strong influence on cancer risk, inherited genetic mutations, particularly in the **BRCA1** and **BRCA2** genes, play a major role in hereditary breast cancer (Obeagu & Obeagu, 2024). Women who carry harmful variants in these genes have a high lifetime risk of developing the disease, with estimates of about 72% for BRCA1 carriers and 69% for BRCA2 carriers by the age of 80 (Kuchenbaecker et al., 2017; Irelli et al., 2024).

**Age of menarche**, which marks the onset of menstruation and the commencement of exposure to reproductive hormones, is one of the modifiable or semi-modifiable risk variables being studied in genetically predisposed populations (Krum‑Hansen, 2024). Since estrogen and progesterone stimulate breast tissue proliferation and can promote tumorigenesis, an earlier menarche has been strongly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in the general population (Beral et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2024). According to new research, these hormones may affect tumor features differently in carriers of **BRCA1 mutations** than in carriers of **BRCA2 mutations**, depending on the gene and subtype (Kim et al., 2017).

BRCA1-related breast cancers are mostly **triple-negative**, meaning they do not express estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (Paluch-Shimon et al., 2016). This type of tumor is found in approximately 66% to 70% of cases involving BRCA1 mutations (Zhang et al., 2022). In contrast, BRCA2-related tumors are more often **estrogen receptor positive**, with a meta-analysis reporting that 58% of breast cancers linked to BRCA mutations show estrogen receptor expression. These distinct patterns suggest that the age at which menstruation begins may influence breast cancer risk differently depending on the gene. It appears to have a **stronger effect in BRCA2 carriers**, likely because their tumors respond to hormones, while the impact may be **less pronounced in those with BRCA1 mutations** (Pujol et al., 2022).

According to a recent retrospective cohort analysis of more than 2,000 carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, early menarche (≤14 years) was linked to a significantly higher risk of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers (HR = 3.49; 95% CI: 2.13–6.00), but not in BRCA1 carriers. This finding supports the idea that estrogen-related hormonal exposure is a crucial, gene-specific factor in BRCA2-driven carcinogenesis (Mavaddat et al., 2018). Further investigation into this relationship has been conducted through large-scale epidemiological studies, such as those by the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA), which have shown that early life hormonal exposure such as age at menarche may influence breast cancer risk differently depending on whether the mutation occurs in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (Nagelkerke, van den Broek, & Hoogerbrugge, 2025).

## CONCLUSION

Age at menarche is a relevant hormonal risk factor for breast cancer and appears to moderately influence risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, while its impact on BRCA1 carriers is minimal. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the complex relationship between hormonal exposures and genetic susceptibility in breast cancer.
