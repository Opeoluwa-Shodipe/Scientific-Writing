## 1.0 Introduction

The development of high-throughput sequencing technology has enabled the generation of enormous volumes of genetic data, making genomics one of the biological study areas with the greatest pace of growth. However, because of its great dimensionality and complexity, interpreting this data continues to be a significant issue (Davis, 2022). Machine learning and deep learning, two subfields of artificial intelligence (AI), provide strong tools for automating and enhancing the interpretation of genetic data. Numerous phases of genomic research, such as variant calling, gene expression analysis, and the discovery of disease-related biomarkers, can benefit from artificial intelligence. With an emphasis on its effects on drug development, personalized medicine, and illness prediction, this paper examines the use of AI in the interpretation of genetic data (Abdelwahab & Torkamaneh, 2025).

## 2.0 Variant Calling and Mutation Detection

Machine learning improves SNP and indel discovery using sequencing data. DeepVariant's convolutional neural network remains the gold standard (Poplin et al., 2018), although subsequent models have improved performance even more. For example, Clair3-MP, which combines Oxford Nanopore and Illumina data, improves F1 scores in complicated genomic areas (Qian et al., 2023). The VariantTransformer, a Transformer-based model, improves variant calls from low-coverage data with around 89% accuracy (Abdelwahab & Torkamaneh, 2024). GPU acceleration technologies such as gpuPairHMM significantly speed up fundamental variant-calling algorithms (Schmidt et al., 2024). These developments represent a significant improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of AI-based variant callers.

### 2.1 Gene Expression Analysis

Machine learning (ML) models are widely used with RNA-seq data to improve expression profile categorization, discover biomarkers, and detect co-expression patterns (Levy & Myers, 2016). Recent techniques use deep learning frameworks and variational autoencoders to deal with the high dimensionality of gene expression data. A cVAE model trained on pan-cancer expression patterns enhanced tumor classification accuracy in multicancer scenarios by around 98% (Polepalli, 2025). These methods demonstrate how machine learning techniques may enrich data, improve classifier performance, and reveal subtle expression patterns in genomics.

### 2.2 Epigenomics and Regulatory Genomics

Deep learning has improved our ability to comprehend non-coding areas by predicting chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and functional regulatory elements. DeepSEA, for example, was the first to use neural networks to predict chromatin characteristics from DNA sequence data (Zhou & Troyanskaya, 2015). EpiGePT, a transformer-based model that combines genomic sequence and transcription factor environment, has significantly increased accuracy in predicting chromatin states across cell types (Zhou et al., 2024). These models provide more understanding into how non-coding mutations affect regulatory processes and gene expression.

### 2.3 Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)

AI and machine learning provide high-dimensional data modeling, which improves the discovery of variant-trait relationships and polygenic risk scores (Abraham et al., 2017). Unlike traditional GWAS techniques, which frequently use linear models, ML methods such as random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning may account for complicated non-linear interactions between genetic variants. This skill improves prediction accuracy for complicated diseases such as diabetes, schizophrenia, and cancer. Recent research has also highlighted the integration of machine learning with large-scale biobank datasets (e.g., UK Biobank), which considerably increases disease risk classification across populations (Torkamani et al., 2023).

### 2.4 Precision Medicine and Clinical Genomics

AI models use multi-omics and clinical data to predict treatment outcomes, particularly in cancer (Topol, 2019). Beyond cancer, machine learning technologies are increasingly being used in rare genetic illnesses, cardiology, and infectious diseases, allowing physicians to adapt medicines to patients' unique genomic profiles. Deep learning has also improved the prediction of immunotherapy results, drug resistance, and side effects, resulting in faster clinical decision-making (Johnson et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2024).

### 2.5 Pathogen Genomics and Outbreak Tracking

Machine learning helps with genomic monitoring of diseases like Plasmodium falciparum and SARS-CoV-2 by quickly assessing mutation patterns for resistance and transmission dynamics (Ogunleye & Wang, 2020). Recent deep learning frameworks have improved the prediction of viral variant formation, antibiotic resistance hotspots, and real-time epidemic tracking, allowing for quicker public health interventions and directing vaccine or medication development (Yoon et al., 2023).

## 3.0 Case Study: Machine Learning for Lynch Syndrome Detection

Microsatellite instability, clinicopathologic characteristics from TCGA via cBioPortal, and somatic genomics (mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, and BRAF) were integrated to create a machine-learning scoring model that flags probable Lynch syndrome in colorectal cancer patients. Using 10-fold cross-validation and group regularization, the model tested on 20% of 524 cases and trained on 80% of them, exceeding clinical-only baselines with 100% sensitivity and specificity, AUROC, and AUPRC of 1.0. Particularly in environments with limited resources, this illustrates how AI might prioritize candidates for confirmatory germline testing (Chambuso et al., 2025).

### 3.1 Advantages of AI and ML in Genomic Data Analysis

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in genomic data processing has significantly outperformed traditional statistical and computational methodologies. One notable advantage is the increased precision and sensitivity of variant calling, particularly for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and tiny insertions/deletions (indels). Unlike traditional pipelines, which frequently struggle in repetitive or GC-rich regions of the genome, AI-powered models perform better with fewer false positives and negatives, and they can effectively handle both short-read and long-read sequencing technologies (Abdelwahab & Torkamaneh, 2025).

### 3.2 Challenges of Applying AI and ML in Genomic Data Analysis 

- **Bias and Fairness:** Training datasets are often skewed toward specific populations, leading to biased predictions and poor generalizability across diverse genetic backgrounds (Duong & Solomon, 2025).  
- **Interpretability of Models:** Many deep learning models function as “black boxes,” making it difficult to explain biological insights or validate predictions in clinical contexts (Chen et al., 2024).
