## Abstract

Molecular genetics has witnessed a revolution because of the combination of big data and machine learning (ML), which makes it possible to analyze complicated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenomic data with confidence. Gene discovery, variant interpretation, functional genomics, and precision medicine have all benefited from the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques...
